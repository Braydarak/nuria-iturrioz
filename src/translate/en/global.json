    "p2": "At 14, my life moved to Madrid for the next 5 years at the CAR (High Performance Center). There I grew, learned, and formed myself as a person, accumulating tournaments and trophies.",
    "p3": "The death of my father meant a great loss, certainly the most complicated situation I have had to live. Everything I am now, I owe to his effort and his vision to involve me in golf at just 6 years old.",
    "p4": "Another decision in my life was not to go to the USA to pursue a university degree, as my goal was to become a professional soon. My future was cut short by pancreatitis that totally limited me from going to the 2nd stage of the qualifiers to compete in the Professional Golf League having passed the first stage a month earlier.",
    "p5": "In 2016, after qualifying in December in the LET, my adventure begins without forgetting my main goal, to be one of the best in the LPGA.",
    "p6": "I continue to pursue my main goal, to be the best golfer in the world, although I would also like to highlight my focus on qualifying for the Solheim Cup and the Olympics.",
